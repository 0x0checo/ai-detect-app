## Overview

This folder includes code written during my first summer internship. In addition to data cleaning, my main task was to explore BERT-based approaches for:

- Text generation (BERT-style generation experiments)
- AI-generated text detection (classification-based detection)

These experiments did not lead to a robust detector, but the code is preserved here to document the attempted methods, training/evaluation pipeline, and lessons learned throughout the process. But confidentially, some codes are modified.
